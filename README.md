Hey there! 👋 

I'm Pankaj - a software engineer obsessed with building **weird**, **fun**, and occasionally **useful** things. I ship for laughs, learning, and the love of building.

When I’m not working on large-scale systems, I’m probably:
- Debugging distributed systems for fun
- Writing about databases and architecture on [my blog](https://your-blog-link.com),
- Or shipping another side project I thought of at 2 AM.

## My Side Projects That Got People Talking
