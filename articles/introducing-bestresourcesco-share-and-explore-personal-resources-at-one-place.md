Namaste üôè

I am Pankaj, a self taught software developer passionate about exploring tech. Today, I feel extremely proud to launch https://bestresources.co - my submission for [HarperDB hackathon](https://townhall.hashnode.com/announcing-harperdb-hackathon-on-hashnode) on @[Hashnode](@hashnode)

## Motivation 

One fine day, I was having a technical discussion on a Linkedin comment thread.  I had written a blog post on [Apache Kafka](https://blog.pankajtanwar.in/the-basics-you-need-to-know-about-kafka-graphic-explanation-ahead) so I was asked if I could share some good resources available on the same. 

This was my moment of inspiration to build a solution for the tiring, cumbersome job of finding the relevant resources. How do you actually learn something new in today‚Äôs life? 

Suppose you want to learn JavaScript. There are plenty of resources available on the web. You hit a search on google, and you start reading. You waste a plenty of time to find some perfect resources for you. 

But here is the catch! When someone else starts learning JavaScript, he too repeats the same cycle. How can the process be expedited?

What if you could share your personal resources with the guy? What if you had access to the resources used by seniors engineers at the first place? It would have saved a tons of time.

Well, there are a couple of ways, some of the devs post a blog sharing your resources. BUT this is not scalable. Not everyone can find their blogs on the internet. 

One, will have to dig deeper. It takes a lot of time to find something worthy. 

I felt the need of a dedicated platform, where people can share their resources, personally used by them.

Introducing Bestresources.co - a free platform for the community to share & get direct access to the personal resources of the community.

https://bestresources.co is now live with curated resources by senior developers from Google, Amazon, Uber etc and so many self taught developers &  freelancers.

## Our Story 

Story of https://bestresources.co started with a comment. Initially, I didn‚Äôt pay much attention to this idea and put it aside (like every other dev). But on 19 June, I got to know about the HarperDB hackathon by Hashnode & it motivated me to work on it. 

I had a very limited time but I decided to finish the development and launch it anyhow. 

I had to manage my regular job, my freelancing projects and other work. I enjoyed working late at night . I continued to ship features as much as possible. I had already made up my mind that I will not keep it as a demo project, whatever it takes, I will launch it.

And within 1.5 week, I was able to launch bestresoures.co üéâ
